        <p><em>BSc Computing <strong>Student</strong>.</em></p>
        <p>I am a student, currently completing a degree in Computer Sciences through the University of South Africa(<a href="https://www.unisa.ac.za/sites/corporate/default">UNISA</a>).<br>
          I've got a strong passion for gaming and have been playing games for most of my life.<br> Learning how games are created and the fundamental ideas of how they work has been one of the core reasons I started working towards this career path.</p>
